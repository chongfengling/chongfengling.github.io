Welcome to my personal website, a work-in-progress hub where I showcase my past projects and ongoing work. I am a recent graduate passionate about developing and optimizing programs for complex problems. Feel free to explore!

During my academic journey, I have acquired a strong foundation in programming language, machine learning and applying numerical methods as well as critical evaluation to science and engineering projects. 

Passionate about open source. Led the development of an open source knowledge-sharing platform on Github Pages tailored for undergraduates.
